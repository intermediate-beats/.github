## Stuck in the middle
Welcome to Intermediate Beats.

We are lifetime learners of making tunes. We're definitely not experts, but not quite noobs. We're not afraid to RTFM or hit up a search engine. But we find that most of the content out there is written for people who are further down or further up the mountain.  

For now, content is organized in repositories based specific tools, with most of the content in each repo's wiki. Any or all of this may change.

There are no leaders or followers here - just jump in and learn. If you have something to share, please do. If you think something could be better, please file an issue or PR on the appropriate repository.
